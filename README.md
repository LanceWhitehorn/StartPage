# Start Page

## Background
When I came across [r/Startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/), the part of me that loves to customise things (especially those that I use often) got excited! Currently, the only customisation I have for my startpage is a wallpaper but that's about it. Coding my own allowed me to make a minimalist startpage that is aesthetically pleasing to me.

I am learning how to code with the MERN stack at the moment so, while I could've done this as a one page html file with jQuery, I wanted to make this using React as overkill as that is.

## Features
* Greeting
* Search box (that opens a Google search in a new tab)
* 5-day weather (credit goes to [joshbader](https://codepen.io/joshbader/pen/EjXgqr) for the animated weather icons)

## Use
In `App.js`, you can customise this to your own name and city.
```javascript
const name = "Lance" // Change to your name
//...
const city = "Sydney" // Change to your city
const app_id = "" // Change to your app id
```
